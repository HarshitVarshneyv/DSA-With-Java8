# DSA with Java & Java 8 🚀

Welcome to **DSA with Java & Java 8**! 🎯
This repository is dedicated to practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java, focusing not only on core Java concepts but also on the **modern features introduced in Java 8** to write clean, concise, and efficient code.

---
 
## 📌 Objectives

* Strengthen **DSA concepts** with hands-on coding in Java.
* Learn and apply **Java 8 features** like:

  * **Streams API**
  * **Lambda Expressions**
  * **Functional Interfaces**
  * **Method References**
  * **Optional Class**
* Practice writing **optimized and readable solutions** using both traditional Java and Java 8 approaches.
* Build a solid foundation for **problem-solving and interviews**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Java (JDK 8 & above)
* **IDE**: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* **Build Tool**: No external build tools (plain Java for learning purposes)
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 📖 Topics Covered

### Core DSA in Java

* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Sorting & Searching
* Hashing & HashMap
* Trees & Graphs
* Dynamic Programming

### Java 8 for DSA

* Using **Streams** for data processing
* Implementing **custom comparators with lambdas**
* Leveraging **filter-map-reduce** in problem-solving
* Cleaner **forEach loops** with method references
* Handling **null safety with Optional**

---

## 🏆 Why Java 8 for DSA?

* **Conciseness**: Lambdas & streams reduce boilerplate code.
* **Readability**: Functional style makes code cleaner.
* **Efficiency**: Streams and parallel streams can boost performance.
* **Modern Approach**: Most companies expect familiarity with Java 8 features.
